# Valid-Parenthesis
This project solves the **LeetCode Valid Parentheses problem** using **Stack** in Java.   The program checks if a given string containing `()`, `{}`, and `[]` has properly balanced brackets.



## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Given a string `s` containing just the characters:
- `(`, `)`,  
- `{`, `}`,  
- `[`, `]`  

Determine if the input string is valid.

A string is valid if:
1. Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.  
2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
